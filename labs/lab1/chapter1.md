# LAB 1: docker Refresh

In this lab we will explore the docker environment within the CDK. If you are familiar with 
docker this may function as a brief refresher. If you are new to docker this 
will serve as an introduction to docker basics. Don't worry, we will progress
rapidly. To get through this lab, we are going to focus on the environment 
itself as well as walk through some exercises with a couple of docker images 
/ containers to tell a complete story and point out some things that you might 
have to consider when containerizing your application.

This lab should be performed on **workstation.example.com** unless otherwise instructed.

The **cdk.example.com** running minishift should have been brought up in lab0. 
You can access that machine using the ```oc``` and ```docker``` commands as shown
in lab0.

Expected completion: 15-20 minutes

Agenda:

* Review docker and systemd
* Review docker help
* Explore a Dockerfile
* Build an image
* Launch a container
* Inspect a container
* Build docker registry


Perform the following commands as student unless instructed otherwise.

## docker and systemd

Check out the systemd unit file that starts docker on the CDK and notice that 
it includes 3 EnvironmentFiles. These files tell docker how the docker daemon, 
storage and networking should be set up and configured. Take a look at those 
files too. Specifically, in the /etc/sysconfig/docker file check out the registry 
settings. You may find it interesting that you can `ADD_REGISTRY` and 
`BLOCK_REGISTRY`. Think about the different use cases for that.

```bash
minishift ssh
cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
cat /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker-storage-setup.service
cat /etc/sysconfig/docker
cat /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage
cat /etc/sysconfig/docker-network
```

Now check the status of docker within minishift.

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

## docker Help

Now that we see how the docker startup process works, we should make sure we 
know how to get help when we need it.  Run the following commands to get familiar 
with what is included in the docker package as well as what is provided in the man 
pages. Spend some time exploring here. The CDK automatically sets up storage 
for us by creating an LVM thin pool for use as a device mapper direct docker 
storage backend.


Check out the executables provided:

```bash
rpm -ql docker | grep bin
```

Check out the configuration files that are provided:

```bash
rpm -qc docker
```

Check out the documentation that is provided:

```bash
rpm -qd docker
```

Now exit out of the minishift VM by disconnecting from the SSH session:

```bash
exit
```

Please run the following command to get access to the minishift docker. When you run
`docker info` check out the storage configuration. 

```bash
eval $(minishift docker-env)
docker --help
docker run --help
docker info
```

Take a look at the docker images on the system. You should see some 
Openshift images that are cached in the CDK so you can start OpenShift 
without having to wait for the container images to download.
  
```bash
docker images
```

## Let's explore a Dockerfile

Here we are just going to explore a simple Dockerfile. The purpose for this is 
to have a look at some of the basic commands that are used to construct a docker 
image. For this lab, we will explore a basic Apache Dockerfile and then confirm 
functionality.

As the vagrant user, change directory to `~/labs/lab1/` and `cat` out the Dockerfile

```bash
cd ~/summit-2017-container-lab/labs/lab1
cat Dockerfile
```
```dockerfile
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7
MAINTAINER Student <student@foo.io>

ADD ./custom.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/custom.repo
RUN yum -y update && yum clean all
RUN yum -y install httpd && yum clean all
RUN echo "Apache" >> /var/www/html/index.html
RUN echo 'PS1="[apache]#  "' > /etc/profile.d/ps1.sh

EXPOSE 80

# Simple startup script to avoid some issues observed with container restart 
ADD run-apache.sh /run-apache.sh
RUN chmod -v +x /run-apache.sh

CMD [ "/run-apache.sh" ]
```

Here you can see in the `FROM` command that we are pulling a RHEL 7 base image 
that we are going to build on. We are also adding a custom yum repo file. In disconnected 
lab environments this file will be used to reference a local yum repository.
In non-disconnected environments you will get access to content by
registering the system. Registration is done for you in the CDK on bringup via
Vagrant. Containers that are being built inherit the subscriptions of
the host they are running on, so you only need to register the host
system.

After gaining access to a repository we update the container and install `httpd`.
Finally, we modify the index.html file, `EXPOSE` port 80, which 
allows traffic into the container, and then set the container to start with a 
`CMD` of `run-apache.sh`.  


## Build an Image

Now that we have taken a look at the Dockerfile, let's build this image.

```bash
docker build -t redhat/apache .
```

## Run the Container


Next, let's run the image and make sure it started.

```bash
docker run -dt -p 1080:80 --name apache redhat/apache
docker ps
```

Here we are using a few switches to configure the running container the way we 
want it. We are running a `-dt` to run in detached mode with a psuedo TTY. Next
we are mapping a port from the host to the container. We are being explicit here.
We are telling docker to map port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container. 
Now, we could have let docker handle the host side port mapping dynamically by 
passing a `-p 80`, in which case docker would have randomly assigned a port to 
the container. Finally, we passed in the name of the image that we built earlier.


Okay, let's make sure we can access the web server.

```bash
curl http://cdk.example.com:1080
Apache
```

Now that we have built an image, launched a container and confirmed that it is 
running, lets do some further inspection of the container. We should take a look 
at the container IP address.  Let's use `docker inspect` to do that.

## Time to Inspect

```bash
docker inspect apache
```

We can see that this gives us quite a bit of information in json format. We can
scroll around and find the IP address, it will be towards the bottom.

Let's be more explicit with our `docker inspect`

```bash
docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' apache
```

You can see the IP address that was assinged to the container.

We can apply the same filter to any value in the json output. Try a few 
different ones.

Now lets look inside the container and see what that environment looks like. Execute commands in the namespace with `docker exec`.


```bash
docker exec <container-name OR container-id> <cmd>
docker exec -it apache bash
```

Now run some commands and explore the environment. Remember, we are in a slimmed
down container at this point - this is by design. You may find yourself restricted.


```bash
ps aux
ls /bin
cat /etc/hosts
ip addr
```

Well, what can we do?  You can install software into this container.

```bash
yum -y install iproute
ip addr
```

Exit the container namespace with `CTRL+d` or `exit`.


Whew, so we do have some options. Now, remember that this lab is all about 
containerizing your existing apps. You will need some of the tools listed 
above to go through the process of containerizing your apps. Troubleshooting 
problems when you are in a container is going to be something that you get 
very familiar with.

Before we move on to the next section let's clean up the apache container 
so we don't have it hanging around.

```
docker rm -f apache
```

## Deploy a Container Registry

To prepare for the next lab let's deploy a simple registry to store our images.

Inspect the Dockerfile that has been prepared. Notice the defaults that have been 
chosen. These may be overriden.

```cat registry/Dockerfile```

Build the registry

```docker build -t registry registry/```

Run the registry in daemonized mode using default parameters. However, we want to 
make sure this container always comes back on docker restarts or machine reboots.
As a result, we include ```--restart="always"```.

```docker run  --restart="always" --name registry -p 5000:5000 -d registry```

Confirm the registry is running.

```docker ps```

In the [next lab](../lab2/chapter2.md) we will be pushing our work to this registry.
